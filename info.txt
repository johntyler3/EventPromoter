Classes and Code from Other Sources:
- TimePickerDialogFragment.java, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35621429/datetimepicker-android, I used the onCreateDialog from this stackoverflow answer to get my timepicker edittext to work. By extension, I used some similar code for the DatePickerDialogFragment. That was written using what I learned from the TimePickerDialogFragment

- MainActivity.java, https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/admin/retrieve-data, For downloading events from firebase, I used the Google Documentation as a template.

- MapsActivity.java, https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/map-with-marker, Basically used the code from the Google Maps API guide to help set up the google map
